                                  HOW TO BUILD

   1.  Read the NEWS file to find out about the exciting new features in
       this version. Other good reads are doc/example.conf, and
       README.FIRST.

   2.  Run the configure script. It will create include/setup.h and the
       Makefiles to match your system. In ircd-ratbox, the paths are now handled
       with the --prefix option to configure, not in config.h.
       $HOME/ircd is the default if no prefix is specified.

       ./configure --prefix="/usr/local/ircd"

         Note: There are some special optional parameters to the configure
         script that some admins may wish to use.

          --enable-kqueue - Use the superior kqueue(2) system call as
            opposed to the default poll(2). This is currently only available
            on FreeBSD 4.1 or higher.

          --enable-devpoll - Enable the superior /dev/poll support on
            Solaris. Linux /dev/poll is broken and will not work with this
            option.

          --enable-epoll - Enable the superior Linux Edge-Triggered Polling
            system. This is currently only available on 2.5 Linux kernel
            versions or later.

          --enable-openssl - Enable the openssl dependent crypto functions.
            This will allow CHALLENGE to work and encrypted links. On systems
            where the configure script can automatically detect OpenSSL, this
            option is not necessary. If configure cannot find OpenSSL, you
            must specify a path with this option
            (--enable-openssl=/path/to/openssl)

          --enable-ipv6 - Enable IPv6 support.

          --disable-assert - Disable some of the debugging code. This
            should be used on all production servers for maximum speed and to
            prevent cores from things that shouldn't normally happen.

          --enable-small-net - Tunes the server for smaller networks by
            reducing the startup memory footprint. This should really only be
            used for *small* networks, as this tends to be a performance hit
            on larger networks.

          --with-nicklen=LENGTH - Sets the maximum NICK length. Note that
            this must be consistent across your entire network.
            
   3. `make` should build ircd.

   4. `make install` will install the server, modules, and tools in the
       the prefix specified when configure was run.

   5.  If you wish to enable the user log, oper log, and failed oper log,
       issue these commands at the shell prompt (in the prefix directory)

       $ touch logs/userlog
       $ touch logs/operlog
       $ touch logs/foperlog

       Note: If you use different names in ircd.conf, you must 'touch' the specific names.

                                HOW TO GET HELP

	The best way to get help regarding bugs and such is by asking on our
	IRC channel which is at irc.geeksirc.net #fircd . Bugs can also
	be filed on our bugtracker at: 
	
	http://bitbucket.org/mullman/fircd/issues/?status=new&status=open

                                     NOTES

   The best way to get a backtrace of the core is to follow this sequence of
   instructions:

   1. Change to the directory containing the core file

   2. Run gdb on the binary and the core file. With an unmodified ircd-ratbox
       installation, an example command line is below (in the /usr/local/ircd
       directory)

       $ gdb bin/ircd ircd.core

   3. At the "(gdb)" prompt, enter the command "bt"

   4. Save the output of the backtrace command and send it to ircd-ratbox@lists.ratbox.org

   5. Be sure to save the ircd binary, the modules, and the core file in a
       safe place in case the developers need to look deeper than a backtrace
       provides.

#Fix bug on ban mask where users are able to do *!*!*!*!*@*

#*MAYBE* Strip permissions from +a to only have it as a protection from kick feature rather than a glorified +o

#Finish creating channel mode +u (paranoid mode)

#Add in ability to mask servers from non-opers

###Down the road

#Change +x mute ban to a ban mask $ instead.

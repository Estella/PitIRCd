#Make user effected channel modes truncate apon placement (i.e., stop being able to do "X has set mode +ooooo on yyyyyy"

#Prevent operators and below from removing +o on founders and admins (the +o modes don't stick with admin & founder)

#Fix bug on ban mask where users are able to do *!*!*!*!*@*

#Strip permissions from +a to only have it as a protection from kick feature rather than a glorified +o

#Finish creating channel mode +u (paranoid mode)

###Down the road

#Change +x mute ban to a ban mask $ instead.

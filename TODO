#Prevent operators and below from removing +o on founders and admins (the +o modes don't stick with admin & founder)

#Fix bug on ban mask where users are able to do *!*!*!*!*@*

#Strip permissions from +a to only have it as a protection from kick feature rather than a glorified +o

#Finish creating channel mode +u (paranoid mode)

#Add in helper mode

#Add in ability to mask servers from non-opers

###Down the road

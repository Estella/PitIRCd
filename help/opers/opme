OPME <#channel>

-- Allows a oper to gain ops in a opless channel
This command simply allows a oper to gain channel operator status in an
opless channel. This is especially useful if all users in a channel
don't have ops, the channel is unregistered and you don't want to
clear the channel for a user to get ops back.

Oper priv required: oper:admin

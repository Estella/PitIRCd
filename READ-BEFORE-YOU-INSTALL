     I will write this first because it is VERY VERY IMPORTANT. When you define
     your services in ircd.conf 
     (example)
     		service {
			name = "services.whatever.net";
			name = "extended.whatever.net";
			name = "stats.whatever.net";
			};
	 (/example)
	 %%%YOU MUST ALSO DEFINE YOUR SERVICES/COPY THAT BLOCK IN ALL OTHER ircd.conf LEAVES AND HUBS.
	 IF YOU DON'T YOUR IRCd ***WILL*** SEG FAULT. SO DO IT.%%%

     					Quick Install (under 5 minutes)

     	Before you start to compile your new IRCd, just follow these simple steps
     	and you will have your server up and running in minutes without problems.

     	1. Add a new user for the ircd. Just simple do: adduser ircd
     	2. Use your account as your new user (e.x. ircd) by doing: su ircd
     	3. Now you should be using your system as the new user. Type: cd ~ 
     	to go in to your new user's home directory.
     	4. Now that you are in your users home directory, simple do a weget
     	to download the ircd. Example: wget http://example.com/fircd.zip
     	5. Now that you have your new IRCd downloaded, if the file is a .zip
     	run unzip file.zip or if it is a .tar.gz then simply do tar -zxvf file.tar.gz
     	6. Now that you have uncompressed the folder, enter the new folder that was 
     	created. example: cd FIRCd-master
     	7. Now that you are in the folder, it's time to compile. For the quickest 
     	way, just enter in this command: ./configure && make && make install
     	This will compile the ircd and install it in your users home directory.
     	i.e. /home/ircd/ircd
     	8. You're almost done! Go back to your home directory, cd ~ , and enter
     	ircd/etc and modify example.conf. (You can use nano or ftp to modify it).
     	9. After you have modified the example.conf file, change the file name 
     	to ircd.conf.
     	10. Alright! Now that you have set you ircd.conf, simple go to ~/ircd/bin
     	and ./ircd to start it!

     	Notes* You may use reference.conf for references on what each paramter does.

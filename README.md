# elemental-ircd

**elemental-ircd** is a high performance, lightweight, and scalable
IRC daemon. It is a fork of the now-defunct ShadowIRCD created to meet
PonyChat's needs, and seeks to continue in the direction ShadowIRCD
was headed.

## Supported Platforms

    <Cassy> If you put something on a platform which cannot support it
            it may tip and fall and become broken. Simple physics.

## Support

Our support channel is `#rainbow-factory` on `irc.ponychat.net`. Poke
**aji** or **Kabaka** for help.
